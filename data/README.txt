Note:
1. This dataset is synthetic data, which means some data may look unrealistic. However, you can just take them as a kind of visual representation.
2. Because of lack of materials, some categories are difficult to synthesis, such as 1, 3, 6, leading to low diversity of these categories. If you cannot obtain good results, please try to skip these categories.
3. This dataset is only for evaluation and you collect data from google material design for practical applications.
